# Recommender Systems

Recommender System models provide personalized recommendations based on user’s profile and interest.
It not only help the user find the best item/movie but also bring potential profits to online service providers like Netflix, Amazon, YouTube.
Applied in variety of applications like movies, songs, research articles, books, etc

* Challenging for the users to select which movies to watch given millions of movies.
* Recommender systems minimizes the options based on the user’s profile and interest thereby reducing the need for the user to scroll a bunch of website pages.
* Applied traditional as well as Deep Learning architectures for efficiently finding the best-matched movies to watch.

We have implemented three algorithms, Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF), Neural Collaborative Filtering(MLP) and Neural Matrix Factorization Model (NMF). We used non-linear approximators such as Deep neural Networks for all the three algorithms. We also investigated how pre-training the model affects the performance of the model. To assess the performance of the model, we have used Hit Ratio and NDCG as the metrics. We also investigated different architectures, embedding size and regularization coefficient to improve the performance. Due to computational complexity, we have restricted our number of episodes to 100.

1) Create a folder "Big_Data_Analytics" and save the dataset "ML-100K".
2) All the files will get automatically saved in the "Big_Data_Analytics" folder once the program is run
